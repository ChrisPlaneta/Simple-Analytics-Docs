There is no need to add us to the privacy policy of your website, but we still encourage you to do so in order to be as transparent as possible with your visitors. This is a template you can use or take inspiration from:

>We at website.com use Simple Analytics for website analytics. Simple Analytics collects and processes anonymous metrics and provides us with information to help us understand how visitors use our website and where our traffic comes from.

>Simple Analytics allows us to improve our website and create a better experience for our visitors. We do not track or profile visitors and we do not serve personalized advertising. We do not share this data with anyone.

>Simple Analytics is a privacy-friendly tool and does not collect your personal data. You can learn more about the way Simple Analytics processes data from its website.

To get critical information about the behavior of our visitors, we use
<a href="https://simpleanalytics.com" target="_blank">Simple Analytics</a>. This
analytics software gives us insight about our visitors only in general, but not
about individuals per say, as it does not track visitors and does not store any
personal identifiable information.

to their documentation</a> to find out what Simple Analytics collects (and most
importantly what they don't).
