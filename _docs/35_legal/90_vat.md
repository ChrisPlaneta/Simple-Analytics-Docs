By European law we are required to charge [Value Added Tax](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/what-is-vat_en) (VAT) for our European customers. It applies to all goods and services that are bought and sold in the European Union (EU), but there is an exeption.

# European customers

We charge VAT for European countries. But if you are a European business you can opt-out from that VAT by entering a valid business tax ID in your [account settings](https://simpleanalytics.com/account#vat). On your invoice you will see a reverse charge of the VAT.

> If you are a European consumer _(a.k.a. not a business)_ without any tax ID you need to pay VAT, sorry.

# Non-EU customers

VAT is only added for customers located within the EU.
