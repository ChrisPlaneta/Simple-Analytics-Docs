You can embed our script in MailerLite using their feature called "Page code injection". On this page we will explain how to use this feature and help you installing the Simple Analytics script on MailerLite.

Follow these steps to add Simple Analytics to your website:

1. Go to your website settings by navigating from **Sites** > **Websites** > (click the name of your website) > Scroll to **Website settings** > **Edit**

1. We recommend to disable the other analytics tools (for privacy reasons) if you don't use those. It does not disable Simple Analytics. Check the box:

   ![](/images/mailerlite-disable-analytics.jpg)

1. Paste the embed code from [how to add our script](/script) into the **Page code injection** text input field:
