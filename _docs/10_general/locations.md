We do everything in our power to keep our user data safe. First of all we don't collect data we don't need and we go a step further.

## Moving from Iceland to The Netherlands

A year ago we wrote [a blog post](https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/why-we-moved-our-servers-to-iceland) about why we moved to Iceland. In hindsight, this was not a great move. Here is why:

1. The Icelandic Modern Media Initiative was adopted by parliament but didn’t make it into law (so it’s not the internet freedom haven as we thought).
1. Our provider claimed to be the largest in Iceland but not as mature as bigger providers in Europe, which risks the security of our servers and infrastructure.
1. They had downtime twice this year.
1. The internet cables to Iceland are rather slow. Although it’s geographically ideal located between North America and Europe, in practice The Netherlands is a faster location.
1. We don't want to move to Switzerland because it would be a marketing move only. The EU provides better privacy laws than Switzerland.
1. We need to move anyway because our current provider does not offer the servers we need.
1. The second-biggest provider in Iceland is legally located in Honk Kong, not a company where we want to store our data with

We asked our customers if they would be okay with the move and everybody who voted agreed with our decision.

## Protect your privacy

What do we do to protect your privacy and that of your visitors?

1. We only collect what we need and nothing more (why would anybody want to steal that data)
1. You are in control of the data: download it or delete all of it (we don’t own your data)
1. We encrypt your data (our drives are encrypted so if anybody would take them they are useless)
1. We will never sell your data (because it’s yours)
