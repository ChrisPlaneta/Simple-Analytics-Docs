We do everything in our power to keep your data safe. We collect the bare minimum amount of data required to give you a broad picture of your website's visitors and even go a few steps further.

## Data location

Simple Analytics hosts your data in the EU, specifically the Netherlands, [part of the EU](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles/netherlands_en). Dutch companies own the servers and must comply with European and Dutch laws and regulations. [Worldstream](https://www.worldstream.com/) and [Leaseweb](https://www.leaseweb.com/) are our hosting providers.

We use a CDN for most of our customers. The CDN is called Bunny CDN and part of a company called [BunnyWay](https://bunny.net/cdn/), located in Slovenia, [part of the EU](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles/slovenia_en).

## No data transfer to the US

We don't transfer your visitors' data outside of the EU. This includes no data transfer to the United States of America. 

The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Called the ["Schrems II"](https://iapp.org/news/a/the-schrems-ii-decision-eu-us-data-transfers-in-question/) decision, which refers to the ruling that transferring data to US providers violates GDPR regulation. This has been the ruling since July 2020. We have been compliant since the start of our business in 2018.

## Protecting your privacy

What do we do to protect your privacy and that of your visitors?

1. **We only collect what we need and nothing more.** This data probably won't be of much interest to thieves.
1. **You are in control of your data, and you can download or delete it at any time.** We don't own any of it.
1. **The drives storing your data are fully encrypted.** If anybody did manage to steal them, they'd be useless.
1. **We will never sell your data.** Because, once again, it's yours!
