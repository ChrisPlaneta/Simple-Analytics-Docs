We offer you two ways to get your invoices:

1. One is to download them from your [account settings](https://simpleanalytics.com/account) and click on one of the previous invoices.
1. Two is to add your email (or that of your accountant) and receive them by mail. If you choose the last option you will only get future invoices.
