The Events Explorer is a great way to get a quick overview of all events in Simple Analytics. It allows you to export data very quickly and only get the data you need. You can add columns and if a column has different values, it will group by those values. See [add columns](#add-columns).

## Search

You can search (or filter) all events by typing your search query. The fun part, it also includes the other column values when you search.

## Add columns

You can add as many columns as you want. Do note that if a column has a lot of different values it will result in many rows. That's why we disabled the date and some integer fields.

In our case we search for the `buy` event and added the `plan` metadata field. Now it shows us both values (starter, and business).

## Export

You can easily export the data that you currently see to formats you probably love. Microsoft Excel, CSV, and Apple Numbers.
