Simple Analytics has a feature where you can remove referral spam. Not by setting up complex filters, but just with a click on a button.

Let's say you have referral SPAM from _"buy-my-product-now"_ as shown in this dashboard:

This is annoying and make your stats inaccurate. If you want to remove this SPAM please follow these steps to remove it from your dashboard:

1. Click on the _"buy-my-product-now"_ referral and scroll down the page

1. Click on this link at the bottom of that page:

1. On the next page **check carefully** if the amount of visits seems correct:

1. Download a copy of your data **(please always do this)**

1. If you have more than 10.000 page views from this referral we can't update your dashboard directly. This means that your dashboard will not show all stats for a few minutes. It is just a warning to inform you of a possible empty dashboard, nothing serious.

1. The removal starts and should be finished in a few seconds or at least a few minutes. Just keep the page open and wait.

> You can also remove SPAM based on the page. This is uncommon, but if you want you can ask us for help or try it yourself. Use this URL (`https://simpleanalytics.com/clean?hostname=example.com&type=path&path=/page`) and replace `example.com` with your domain and `/page` with the page you like to remove. It will ask you to confirm because removing.
