To block your own visits on your website on Safari, you can use the about:blank extension. You can [download about:blank](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/about-blank/id1239207203) via the Mac App Store.

To install this extension and use it for Simple Analytics, you can follow the steps in this tutorial.

You will need the script URL at some point: `https://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com`.

> Do you have a [custom domain](/bypass-ad-blockers)? Make sure to add that to about:blank. For example: `https://simple.yourdomain.com`.

{%
  include video.html
  controls="true"
  slug="docs/about-blank-mac-os-app"
  formats="mp4,ogg,webm,wmv"
  poster="poster.png"
  filename="install-about-blank-on-mac-os"
%}

If you want to block the non-JavaScript version as well you should add `https://queue.simpleanalyticscdn.com` to the block list.

## iOS

On iPhone, you can [download about:blank](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/about-blank/id1239181721) on the App Store. It should sync your block list when you have iCloud enabled. If not, you should add the above URL(s) manually.
