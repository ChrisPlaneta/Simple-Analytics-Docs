If you want to block the non-JavaScript version as well you should add `https://queue.simpleanalyticscdn.com` to the block list.

## iOS

On iPhone you can [download about:blank](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/about-blank/id1239181721) on the App Store. It should sync your block list when you have iCloud enabled. If not you should add the above URL(s) manually.
