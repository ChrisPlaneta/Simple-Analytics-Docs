As a privacy-friendly business, we care a lot about who owns the data. We are very clear in our terms of service ([section 10](https://simpleanalytics.com/general-terms-and-conditions#intellectual-property)) that you (our customer) own the analytics data. We don't. To not just have that in words in our terms, we care about making it easy for you to export your data. You can export your data through [our APIs](/api) or use [our user interface](https://simpleanalytics.com/select-website/export) to export the raw data.

Go to [the export your data](https://simpleanalytics.com/select-website/export) in your dashboard to download your data as a CSV.

If you want to get aggregated data, you'll have to use [our Stats API](/api/stats) for that.
