How can we make it easy to find that data about that specific page/referrer/UTM code? Well, we created filters just for that. With a few clicks, you will find the data you are looking for.

{%
  include video.html
  controls="true"
  red="true"
  slug="filters"
  formats="mp4,ogg,webm,wmv"
  poster="video.png"
%}

Go to [your dashboard](https://simpleanalytics.com/select-website) and start playing with filters.
