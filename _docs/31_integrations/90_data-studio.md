Some customers use [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) for building reports. Because we care about privacy, we don't store any personal data. That's why we are comfortable enough to let customers choose to connect with Data Studio while Google can't abuse our customers' data or their visitors.

This connector lets customers query data from the [API](/api) of [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/). It does need access to your Simple Analytics data. We need the Google scope "connect to an external service" for that.
