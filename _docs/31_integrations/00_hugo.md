You can embed our script in Hugo using their feature called ["Base Template"](https://gohugo.io/templates/base/). On this page we will explain how to use this feature and help you installing the Simple Analytics script with Hugo.

Follow these steps to add Simple Analytics to your website:

1. Open your project
1. Find your base template (usually in `layouts/_default/baseof.html`)
   - If it does not exist, create it.
1. Copy [the embed script](/script) just before the `</body>` tag
1. Save and build the project

> If you have a footer block in your base template you can also choose to paste the embed script there.

If you encounter issues, don't hesitate to contact us via [our support channels](https://simpleanalytics.com/contact).
