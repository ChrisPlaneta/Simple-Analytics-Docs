  controls="true"
  slug="google-tag-manager-integration"
  formats="mov,mp4,ogg,webm,wmv"
  poster="poster.png"
%}

If you prefer text instructions, follow this guide:

1. Click "Add a new Tag"
1. Click "Choose a tag type to begin setup..."
1. Click the blue bar "Discover more tag types in the Community Template Gallery"
1. Search for "Simple Analytics"
1. Click "Add to workspace"
1. Click "Add" in the popup
