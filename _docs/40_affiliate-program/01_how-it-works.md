We depend on our customers and your word-of-mouth. To give something back in return, we give you 50% of the first year's revenue. The new customer gets one month of extra trial. You can create a affiliate link on [your affiliate page](https://simpleanalytics.com/account/referrals) that you can share with others.

## How it works for the affiliate partner

You can request a payout when you have a balance of at least €50, $50, or £50. If you have a Simple Analytics subscription, we will use your balance to pay this subscription first. When scheduled, your payout will be transferred to your bank (via IBAN) or PayPal account after the new customer has paid their invoice. We prepare payouts every first Monday of the month.

To sum it up

- New customer gets one month (one month extra free trial)
- You get 50% of revenue for the first year (of the new customer)
- Your balance will increase with every invoice the customer pays
- After paying your subscription, we will pay out the balance (from 50+) on request

A few examples

- New customer signs up for the business plan (for $588 a year).\
  After they did pay their first invoice, **you get $294** ($588 / 2).
- New customer signs up for the starter plan (for $19 a month).\
  After they did pay their first invoice, **you get $9.50**. Then after they pay their subsequent 11 invoices, **you get $9.50**.
- New customer signs up for the starter plan (for $19 a month).\
  They cancel their plan within one month + 7 days. **You get nothing.**
- New customer signs up for the starter plan (for $19 a month).\
  They fail to pay us. **You get nothing.**

## How it works for new customers

When you, as a potential customer, click the affiliate link, you will see a banner like this:

<img class="border" src="https://assets.simpleanalytics.com/docs/affiliate/banner-homepage.png" alt="Simple Analytics affiliate program banner" />

When you click the **"Accept affiliate deal"** button, we will set a cookie with the affiliate code so we can apply the discount at checkout.

As a new customer, you will get **one month extra for free**, so that the trial period will be 45 days (instead of 14 days). You can always cancel during this period (or after), but we do not provide refunds.

**Note:** We are privacy-focused, so the promoter will not receive any indication of who you are (i.e., you will be anonymous).
