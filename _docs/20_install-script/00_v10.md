This is a tiny update with only 2 changes.

- We fixed a bug where the [callback didn't trigger in `sa_event`](https://github.com/simpleanalytics/scripts/commit/334bd5bd486718c3326eb42a95fa640dcbf07c1d#diff-ee91055a491d35f130f742d7e34ee9a6042ba4458ec6a7698eb2e8b40c8f9729) when metadata was specified.
- We allow for [`sa_settings`](https://github.com/simpleanalytics/scripts/commit/f83d48e5fc5453cc79c79d877d318b97919f51d9) to communicate settings to the script from JavaScript directly. Created for [our official Google Tag Manager tag](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/owners/simpleanalytics/templates/google-tag-manager).
